# Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews 🧠🗣️

This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon Echo product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## 🚀 Overview

The goal is to classify customer reviews as **positive** or **negative** using a supervised learning approach. The dataset is preprocessed and vectorized using **TF-IDF**, and a **Logistic Regression** classifier is trained for binary classification.
